# Walkthrough - Makeup Artist Website

I have created a complete, production-ready React website for a professional makeup artist.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Booking System
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Form submissions automatically open WhatsApp with a pre-formatted message.
- **Local Storage**: Bookings are also saved locally in the browser for record-keeping.
- **Dual Forms**: A compact version in the Hero section and a detailed version on the Contact page.

### 2. Portfolio & Gallery
- **Filterable Grid**: Users can filter portfolio items by category (Bridal, Party, Editorial, etc.).
- **Lightbox**: Clicking an image opens a full-screen modal with a "Book this look" CTA.
- **Masonry Gallery**: A visually appealing gallery layout for behind-the-scenes shots.

### 3. Admin Panel
- **Management**: Add, edit, and delete Services, Portfolio items, and Gallery images.
- **Security**: Simple password protection (`admin123`).
- **Persistence**: Changes are saved to `localStorage`, so they persist across reloads (on the same device).

### 4. Design & UX
- **Theme**: Fully functional Light/Dark mode.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS.
- **Aesthetics**: Premium feel with serif fonts (Playfair Display) and gold/pink accents.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, Hero, BookingForm, etc.).
- `src/pages`: Main route pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Admin, etc.).
- `src/context`: State management for Theme and Data.
- `src/utils`: Helpers for WhatsApp and Storage.
- `src/data`: Initial mock data and type definitions.

## Verification

- **Build**: Ran `npm run build` successfully.
- **Lint**: Fixed unused variables and type import issues.
- **Dependencies**: Downgraded Tailwind CSS to v3 for stability and compatibility.

## Next Steps

- **Deploy**: The `dist` folder generated by `npm run build` is ready for deployment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- **Customization**: Update `src/utils/whatsapp.ts` with the real phone number.
